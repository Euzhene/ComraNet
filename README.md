Description:
The app is huge in comparison with my previous projects. So, I split the entire project into 3 parts:
1. Authorization screen
2. Chat Screen
3. Settings Screen

Features:
- login/register users
- send text messages
- send images from your gallery
- offline mode (load your saved chat data when no internet)
- modern design
- absolutely customizable elements (change the background of Chat Screen or colors of messages, app bar, date divider and more)
- click on a chat image to make it bigger

Libraries:
- firebase authentication
- firebase realtime database
- firebase cloud storage
- coil
- hilt
- room
- paging3
- jetpack compose
- navigation from raamcosta
- gson
- datastore preferences
